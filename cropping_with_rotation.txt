Four cases:
Keep in mind, total_width and total_height always drawn from original image with whatever incorrect rotation may be applied, so no need to swap that.

Whenever an image is passed, we can only guarantee a check on correct proportions between placed image and file read, so we can narrow it down to two options for each of these.

If proportion doesn't match, we are looking at B or D.
If it does, we are looking at A or C

A:
Rotation is correct
x = x
y = y
w = w
h = h

B: 
Rotation is 90 degrees clockwise
x = total_width - (y+h)
y = x
w = h
h = w

C:
Image is flipped
x = total_width - (x+w)
y = total_height - (y+h)
w = w
h = h

D:
Rotation is 90 degrees counterclockwise
x = y
y = total_height - (x+w)
w = h
h = w
